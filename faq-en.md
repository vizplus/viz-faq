## General issues

### How is it correct to write the name of the application – VIZ or viz?

There are no ‘correct’ or ‘official’ terms in VIZ. There are different points of view that are accepted by participants and services to one degree or another. We at VIZPLUS decided on the following:

- **VIZ** is an ecosystem where all applications, blockchains, tokens, instructions and everything else is related to VIZ;

- **Viz** or the ‘VIZ blockchain’ is just the blockchain part, thus, it is the most important software, or the ‘core’ of the ecosystem.

- **viz** is a measurement unit of social capital. A person’s height is measured in centimeters, their weight – in kilograms, and social capital – in viz. We do not like to call viz a ‘coin’, ‘cryptocurrency’ or ‘digital currency’, since it does not refer to money, but is more like points, rating points or even airline miles. When we talk about viz as a means of capital accumulation, we call them ‘tokens’ by analogy with the tokens of other blockchains and blockchain-based applications.

You can write and pronounce it the way you like, as long as those around you understand you well.

### How do I use social capital?

You can use social capital (as well as other functions of the Viz blockchain) through the applications. These apps help you reward people, vote, express gratitude, and do other things with social capital.

Applications create *a context for the use* of social capital, that is, they tell you *why* to use it:

- Reward the author of an interesting article on the internet (click ‘like’ on the website);
- Vote for the best football player of the match by pointing your phone at the QR code on the screen;
- Make a choice on a dating site (attract attention with a solid reward);
- Express gratitude for helpful advice in a chat (write a ‘thank you’, which the bot will turn into a reward)...

The context is limited only by the imagination of the authors in the applications. Technically, applications translate your ‘social’ actions with different contexts into a standard language of the blockchain and conduct a transaction on your behalf.

### How should I act if something is not working?

Novice VIZ participants sometimes find themselves in a situation when ‘something did not work’: a reward did not go through, the tokens were not transferred to another account, a delegation was not canceled, etc. Why is this happening and what is the next step?

Obviously, first, you should make sure that you are **not trying to carry out an impossible operation**, for example, delegate 1,200 viz, if you have only 800 viz available in your capital. Alternatively, you are trying to use 5% of the energy with a reward, despite the fact that only 3% of it remains.

In the vast majority of cases, the application’s refusal to conduct a transaction means the user **has entered a wrong private key**.

First, the key must correspond to the operation you are trying to perform: different types of keys are used for different transactions in Viz blockchain. This makes life a little more complicated, but it makes using VIZ much safer. The correct application should tell you which key you need to enter (simple, active, or even main/master). Save the keys correctly with the appropriate description (sometimes users confuse the key levels when saving) and carefully check which key you enter.

Second, when copying a key from a storage location to an application, users accidentally ‘forget’ 1-2 characters or vice versa, and put in an extra character at the beginning or at the end (space, comma, etc.). The keys are long, anyone can make a mistake. Make sure that you copy the key correctly.

The **application is much less likely to make mistakes** or the **blockchain node is disabled** (the server that the application contacts to record your operation), but still this possibility cannot be excluded. The correct application will tell you the type of error that has occurred and how to avoid it - in this case, follow the instructions. If something completely indescribable happens, wait a couple of minutes and try again.

Finally, the rarest, but possible option is that you do **not have enough social capital** to conduct a transaction with in the first place. This happens either with very ‘minor’ accounts, for example, with 0.1 viz in the capital, or with a very heavy load on the blockchain (usually during a spam attack).

The fact is that the Viz blockchain has limitations on the speed of recording information from users, therefore, it lines up transactions received for saving in a queue under high load. First, the operations of the accounts with the largest capital are executed, then with the smaller one, etc. At the same time, if a transaction from the tail of the queue did not get into the nearest record (in the block), it is rejected.

Let us repeat the aforementioned: a sharp increase in activity on the blockchain is a rare phenomenon. Accounts with at least several viz in the capital should not have problems with recording transactions.

If you have followed all the recommendations, but ‘something still refuses to work’, contact the developers of the application or refer to the chat rooms, where more experienced users will help you with troubleshooting. For example, there is a group for mutual support in Telegram: [VIZ+Help](https://t.me/vizplus_help).

## Accounts and keys

### How do I create an account?

The operation of creating an account in VIZ requires the use of a small amount of social capital or viz tokens. These funds are not spent, but transferred to a new account and frozen on it for a while.

The amounts are set by the delegates and may change occasionally. They amount to at **least 10 viz for delegating capital or at least 1 viz when transferring from a wallet**. Therefore, to create a new account, you must already have an account with a small number of viz or a check for the required amount.

However, there are helpful people in the VIZ ecosystem who use their resources to help newcomers create accounts. For example, VIZPLUS has such a service: [start.viz.plus](https://start.viz.plus). Simply put, if necessary, you can create an account for free (at someone else’s expense), but you should not abuse this, as well as any help.

You can create accounts in applications that provide the given opportunity **at your own expense**. This function is available, for example, in Personal Account [my.viz.plus](https://my.viz.plus), in the social Telegram bot and in other applications.

To create a new account using the funds of an existing one, you need to log into one of the appropriate applications, enter the name of the new account in the appropriate section, select the payment method (from the capital or from the wallet) and click ‘Create’ or similar. At this point, the application will check if there is no account with the same name, whether you have enough funds, and if everything is in order, it will perform the operation of creating a new account. You will receive the keys of the new account, which must be saved in several safe places.

You can also create an account by **depositing the required amount by check**. The sequence is the same: you use an application that provides such a service, enter the name of the future account and the secret part of the check - and if everything is right, you get the keys.

Finally, there is a slightly more complicated way - **using a special anonymous account**. First, you have to generate a key (public and private parts), and then transfer the necessary amount to an anonymous user by writing an account in the comments. Include the key (without spaces), where the account is the name of the new account, and the key is the **public** part of the key. The transfer can be made from anywhere, for example, from an exchange or from an exchanger, which makes the new account almost anonymous. On the other hand, if there are services like [start.viz.plus](https://start.viz.plus), where new accounts are initially completely anonymous, this option does not make much sense.

### How do I create a subaccount?

A subaccount can only be created when using resources and signing an account or subaccount of the previous level. For example, if you have a *primer* account, you can create several subaccounts like *second.primer*, *new.primer*, etc. However, the next-level *completely.new.primer* subaccount can only be created using an active key from *new.primer*. The key from the *primer* account will not help in this case.

The cost of creating a subaccount is the same as with a regular account.

The application through which you create a subaccount will definitely request an active key from the previous level account (or use it silently if you entered it during login).

Otherwise, everything is easy – just check whether you have enough funds, enter the name of the subaccount and the amount of tokens to be transferred or delegated and click the ‘Create’ button.

### How do I give a new account to another person as a gift?

If you want to give away an account with a specific name, **create it yourself** and give the person the master key to the new account, reminding them to reset the keys and save the new ones allowing you not to use this account. Keys can be reset no earlier than an hour after account creation or the previous reset.

If you prefer the name of the new account to be chosen by the recipient of the gift, **give them a check** for any amount from 1 viz or more. In this case, the receipt works as an invite. The recipient will create an account on [start.viz.plus](https://start.viz.plus) by entering the secret part of the receipt at the appropriate step. The entire amount of the check will be transferred to the social capital of the new account.

### How do I change my account keys?

The easiest way to change the keys is to ‘reset’ them. Just refuse to use all the old keys with one click of a button in the application and get a set of new ones. To do this, you need to enter the master key.

If you want to change only one key, go to the Accounts - Account Access section in [my.viz.plus](https://my.viz.plus), find the access you need, generate a new one (there is a special button for this), add it, write it down in several places, and then delete the old key. You will also need to enter the master key to perform this operation.

### How do I recover lost keys?

If you have **lost the master key**, it is impossible to restore it or get a new one. Also, in this case, it is impossible to change other keys (but you can still use them). If you lose the master key (and keep the active one), we strongly recommend creating a new account and withdrawing all viz to it, and just forget about the old one. If you lose all the keys, you have to accept this hard lesson for a lifetime.

If your **master key was stolen** and changed, but you still have the old one, you can try to restore access to your account through a special and very complicated procedure. To do this, you will have to find the account owner with whom you created your account and ask them to conduct a special access restoration transaction. Unfortunately, VIZPLUS does not provide such a service for accounts created through [start.viz.plus](https://start.viz.plus).

If **less significant keys are lost**, then reset them as described above and save the new keys in a more secure place. 

### How do I buy or sell a custom account?

The VIZ has a unique feature built directly into the blockchain. With the help of the corresponding application, you can put up any of your account or subaccount for sale or buy the one you like in a couple of clicks. Payment, of course, is done using viz. There is a corresponding section on the [my.viz.plus](https://my.viz.plus) website.

Putting up an account for sale costs a small amount in viz. This is done to protect the blockchain from spam attacks. In addition, it will be possible to buy it only 7 days after it is put up for sale to prevent attackers from quickly selling the stolen account.

Also, the owners of ‘custom’ accounts can give everyone the opportunity to create any subaccounts for a fee. This is similar to registering a domain on the internet. For example, you can create any (unoccupied) subaccount for a com or blog account, etc. At the same time, the owner of the main account will not be able to do anything with this subaccount, since they will not know its access keys.

### How do I view the history of actions in my own or someone else’s account?

On [info.viz.plus/accounts](https://info.viz.plus/accounts) page, you can find information on accounts and subaccounts created by VIZ participants. If you know the name of the account you are interested in, start typing it in the search bar on the page, all suitable accounts will immediately appear in a dropdown list below. Clicking on the name opens the account page with full information and transaction history.

You can also see various sorted lists of accounts in the dropdown.

Not all accounts and transactions are represented on [info.viz.plus/accounts](https://info.viz.plus/accounts), as the blockchain is periodically raided by spammers who create a lot of meaningless operations that are deleted from the site.

All operations in ‘raw’ format, without any filtering, are presented in [VIZ-API](https://api.dpos.space/viz/api/account_history/get_account_history) service. Specify the account name, the number in order of the last transaction you are interested in, and the number of earlier transactions to display on the screen. A little trick: if you just want to see the last 20 transactions, and you do not know the number of the most recent one, enter -1 instead.

## Digital Social Capital

### How to reward other VIZ members?

The main way to reward other people in VIZ is by using appropriate apps. For example, the "social" bot in Telegram allows you to reward participants in discussions in groups where it is switched on. To do this, just start a reply to someone's comment with a "+" sign (from one to five, the size of the reward depends on this), and the author of the comment will receive a reward, i.e. increase his or her social capital. In Telegram channels with the same bot, a button appears below the posts to reward the author.

On the social network [Readdle.Me](https://readdle.me/), an award button is onboarded directly in pages with posts. 

A special plugin for Chrome([link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vizonator/iehoehfkanaobnbldjfjfabbpaiiojnp)) and Firefox ([link](https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/vizonator/)) adds its reward button to pages and posts on Twitter, YouTube and some other sites, as if it was supposed to be there.

A list of applications can be seen on the homepage of [viz.plus](https://viz.plus). Gradually, many services on the Internet and in real life will be framed by apps (stand-alone or universal) for awards in VIZ.

The second way to reward someone is to do it directly, by the name of the recipient account. To do this, in My Account [my.viz.plus](https://my.viz.plus) find the page to reward, enter the name of the account being rewarded in the appropriate field and select the percentage of energy used. If you want, you can add a comment to the recipient, to explain why you're giving the reward. Remember that your energy usage is only 20% per day, so be careful.

### How to connect an account to the app?

There are two ways to connect an account to any app in VIZ. The first is **transferring to the app the necessary private key** (simple or active) from your account. The second is **granting the app the right to act on behalf of your account** without transferring a key. When you connect, the app will ask you for permission to act in one or another way.

Tips about how to keep yourself as safe as possible when using apps in VIZ, you can find in the Best Practices section on this page below.

### How to increase social capital?

Your digital social capital increases when other people reward you in gratitude for something. So, the most obvious and correct way to increase your social capital is to **provide other people with benefit or pleasure**.

A simpler and quicker option is to **purchase some viz tokens** and put them into capital. There isn’t and can’t be a single seller of tokens in VIZ. The system is decentralised, so participants sell and buy viz from each other at a negotiated price.

The sale and purchase of vizes is offered in some apps, as well as in crypto-exchanges (including money) and crypto-stocks. There are also "shops" where you can quickly and easily buy viz-cheques. In addition, it’s always possible to negotiate a direct deal with another participant in popular VIZ chat rooms. You’ll find links to many of the relevant resources on our homepage.

Social capital can also be rented. In this case you pay another VIZ member some money and get the agreed amount of capital by delegation for a certain period of time.

### How to delegate social capital?

Social capital can be delegated temporarily (until you withdraw it) to another account. The recipient only uses it, but can’t withdraw it into tokens, steal it, sell it or give it to someone else. This function is called "delegating" social capital.

The easiest way to delegate social capital is through an app, such as My Account [my.viz.plus](https://my.viz.plus), where it can done with a couple of clicks in the relevant section. Other apps may also offer this option. Be careful and **check** who is asking you to delegate capital and why. Nothing bad will happen anyway, but if scammers use your capital for something illegal, it will be a shame.

To withdraw delegated capital, contact the same app or any other app you trust. Some apps may not have a separate "revoke" button, in which case witness to the same account 0 viz. The withdrawn capital will be deducted from the recipient's capital instantly, but will revert back to you after 24 hours.

Note: increasing and decreasing delegated capital doesn’t work quite normal. If you have delegated 1000 viz to someone and now you want to delegate another 400 viz, you should add 1400 viz to the delegation amount, which is the final amount. Similarly with decrease: if you want to decrease the delegated amount by 400 viz, you must specify the new delegated amount, i.e. 600 viz, not "minus 400".

## Viz tokens and cheques

### How to get liquid viz tokens?

Sometimes you may need liquid viz tokens. For example, to add social capital to your other account, to give viz to a friend or to sell them via exchanger.

If you have enough social capital, you can withdraw (take away, convert) the right amount of tokens from it. The Viz blockchain is purposely built in such a way that it’s impossible to get liquid tokens out of the capital instantly: the withdrawal takes place in parts - no more than 1/28 of the capital per day. Therefore, a small amount can be withdrawn in 1-2 days, while it takes weeks to "cash out" a substantial amount of capital.

A quicker and more obvious way is to buy tokens from exchange, online shops, stocks or from private seller with other VIZ participants. The list of relevant venues varies, so, it’s better to check the locations and terms of transactions on VIZ information resources.

### How to transfer viz tokens from one account to another?

In any wallet or personal account app in VIZ, you will surely find a section for transferring tokens. All you need is the name of the recipient account and your private active key. If you want or need to, you can write a message, comment or service data in the transfer. The recipient will see the transfer information almost immediately, and in about a minute the transaction will be finally stored in the blockchain.

### How to use cheques?

Cheques allow you to transfer liquid viz tokens **outside the blockchain**. You create a cheque with your liquid tokens in the app (one or another wallet or My Account [my.viz.plus](https://my.viz.plus)) and save the public part and the secret part. Then you pass the secret part to another person, who cashes it in the same app in his account, by entering the secret part into the corresponding field.

When you create a cheque, the tokens are withdrawn from your "account" to the cheque, so you can't spend them. But if the cheque isn’t used, you can "cash" it back into your account.

The second way to use the cheque is to deposit it when you create your account. In this case, all of the tokens from the check go into the social capital of the new account.

Regardless of the way of use, the assets from the cheque are withdrawn only as a whole, i.e. the cheque can be cashed only once in full. There are no commissions on the creation and use of cheques.

## Delegates & DAO Fund

### How to elect delegates to DAO Fund?

Unlike elections to national parliaments, the election of delegates to the DAO VIZ is a continuous process. You have the right and opportunity to vote for delegates (one or more) or to withdraw your vote at any time.

Voting is a blockchain transaction like any other and is done through an app. For example, in My Account [my.viz.plus](https://my.viz.plus) on a special page you should tick the relevant account and your choice will be regarded.

When voting, the power of your vote, equal to your social capital, is equally divided among all the delegates you voted for. Therefore, it’s worth deciding in advance whether to give all your votes to one delegate to help him move up the list, or to divide them among several delegates.

### How to vote for applications for DAO Fund?

VIZ members who apply for a payment from the DAO Fund usually try to get as many social capital holders to vote for it as possible. Therefore, if you follow VIZ news, you will probably know that someone has applied.

If you wish to support or reject an application, you can do it in the relevant section of  My Account [my.viz.plus](https://my.viz.plus) or in other apps that provide such service.

When voting, you choose the approval percentage of the application: the higher the average percentage received by the application, the more vizes from the Fund the applicant will receive. A vote of 100% means that you agree to give the applicant the amount they are requesting. A lower percentage will result in a reduced amount.

It is also possible to set a negative percentage (up to -100%): this means that you don’t want to allocate assets from the Fund to the applicant.

You can change your decision at any time up to the end of voting. Please note: the voting on the application takes into account the effective social capital of your account at the end of the voting period. This means that if you voted, and then delegated some of your capital to another account or withdrew some of your capital into liquid tokens, only the remaining capital will be taken into account in the end result. Conversely, if after voting but before the vote is counted, your social capital has increased, your vote will be weighted.

## Best Practices

### What is the best and safest way to use VIZ?

**Separate keys**. The key system in VIZ greatly increases the security of using your account compared to the usual "login + password" system.

Of course, keeping three keys that you can't remember is more difficult than entering `12345asd` password. But in the case of a leak from a site or an app regular keys (which are used to make awards), you lose virtually nothing. Even if the active keys are leaked, your loss is minimal, especially if you use subaccounts from the following advice, and don’t keep any liquid vizes in your wallet.

**Use subaccounts and delegation**. On the one hand, VIZ is convenient because the same account can be used in all applications, accumulating social capital on it and rewarding other participants. On the other hand, it isn’t very safe: the app could be fraudulent or hacked by hackers, leading to trouble with the account.

A good way to increase the security of using VIZ is to have one "main" account with your social capital and one or more subaccounts for different purposes and individual apps.

For example, your main account is `johnnydepp`. You have bought 12500 vizes and put them into the social capital of this account. Now you can create a subaccount `twitter.johnnydepp` and delegate 2400 views to it, a subaccount `telegram.johnnydepp` and delegate 5800 views to it, and a subaccount `iam.johnnydepp` and delegate the rest 4300 views to it. You connect the first two accounts to their respective social gateways, and use the latter for all other tasks. The main account virtually securely holds your social capital and, if you wish, your liquid vizes in your wallet.

Even if you lose or compromise the keys to a sub-account, right down to the master key, nothing will happen: you will simply revoke the delegation and create a new subaccount.

Rewards will accrue in subaccounts, which can be slowly transferred to the main account, or retained to build up your social capital on Twitter and Telegram. You'll only log into your main account safe through the most trusted app, and even rarely.

**Try to use local apps**. Some apps in VIZ know how to work directly with the blockchain without accessing their own server. This is safer and more convenient because there is no middleman, who could be a crook, or his servers could be hacked, or could go offline at the most inopportune moment.

On the other hand, without a server it is unlikely to be possible to build an advanced app with complex features. In some cases, the same application can be presented in two versions - a "basic" local version and an "advanced" server version (as a website or mobile app). It's up to you which version you choose - depending on what you want to do with the app.

For example, [My account](https://my.viz.plus) of a VIZ member works both as a website and as a local web page which you should download to your computer and open in your browser. The local version will work even if the server goes down completely because it doesn’t communicate with it, but directly with the blockchain.
